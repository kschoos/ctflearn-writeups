Quite annoying zip challenge when you don't know that the flag format is ABCTF{...}

Downloaded the file and relatively quickly found that there is "a" zipfile hidden in the png.
Carved that part out and unzipped it. And then I lost a whole lot of time, even though I did "strings", 
I didn't go through them carefully enough, because that's it! Just strings the jpeg and grep for ABCTF.
