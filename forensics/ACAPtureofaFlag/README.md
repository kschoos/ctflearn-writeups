First I aimlessly scrolled through the file.
Looks like there is some http/s traffic.
After a while I decide to filter and go through stuff step by step, so I filter on http traffic alone.
A base64-encoded 'msg'-string comes to my attention that I decode and receive the flag from.

That was quite easy.
